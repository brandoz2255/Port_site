            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! I'm a passionate computer science and cybersecurity enthusiast on a journey of continuous learning. My fascination with technology began in 2018, and I've been diving deep into the realms of cybersecurity ever since.
                Hello! I'm a passionate enthusiast in the realm of Computer Science and Cybersecurity. My journey began in 2018 when my brother introduced me to Hack The Box, sparking a fascination that has grown into a lifelong commitment. My engagement in the CyberPatriot Competition and National Cyber League during high school deepened this passion, particularly as I delved into CLI applications, crucial to both defensive and offensive security.

                My goal is to leverage my knowledge to build resilient defenses, fortify systems, and protect the integrity of our technological infrastructure. </p>
                
            <p>I strive to harmonize the art of programming with the intricacies of cybersecurity, finding joy in crafting elegant CLI applications and developing security tools. My profound curiosity about the inner workings of computers fuels my determination to contribute to the ever-expanding industry of technology.

                I'm motivated by an unwavering commitment to continuous learning, constantly seeking ways to integrate the best cybersecurity practices into programming. My aim is not just to achieve these goals, but to innovate and contribute significantly to the dynamic technological landscape. As I craft my own tools, I'm driven by the goal of facilitating ease of use for others and leaving an indelible mark on the evolving landscape of technology.

                I'm excited to embark on this journey, and I look forward to sharing my progress along the way. </p>
